Being someone who felt like I wasted my youth \(though of course in no small part due to being 17-18 during the pandemic\), I often find myself in the weird space of not quite a kid, but not quite an adult.

In experiencing Sonny Boy, I feel like I've been able to escape that rut a bit.

Soundtrack: 9/10
