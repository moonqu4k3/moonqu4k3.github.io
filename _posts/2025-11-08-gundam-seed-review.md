Gundam SEED remains one of the most popular Gundam franchises to date, and I can see why... to a point. I don't keep it a secret that I tend to prefer older anime (typically late Showa and early Heisei era shows), and I overall tend to prefer traditional animation techniques over the digital shift that SEED was a pioneer of. I did watch the HD remaster of SEED (like 95% of people), so I didn't get to bear witness to the pure awkwardness of the original 2002-2005 production. But the 2010s remasters are still not my cup of tea style-wise. Nearly every character is built from the same face and body model with very little variation. 

Onto the story now. It's very... soapy. Unlike other mecha shows, this one focuses on the characters. Too much. It's frankly impressive how much they focus on the "let's cuck Sai" storyline over the race war going on in the background. I didn't think I could dislike a protagonist as much as I did with Kira. I think I would post after nearly every watch session how much I didn't like him.

As for characters I did like, Athrun and his team in ZAFT were compelling to me. Another child-maintained military complex, Athrun, and firstly Dearka, become disillusioned with their roles in the war and what the right ideals to fight under even are. While much of the Archangel's crew came off as one-dimensioned to me, the ZAFT members, and those who end up in close communication with them, are able to share their qualms and pains of the war, leading both sides to question just what it is they're fighting for. Alongside ZAFT, the characters of Lacus, Cagalli, and Miriallia were some of my favorites. 

Let's back up to the race war for a bit. In the world of SEED, humans are divided into "Naturals", being people who are born without undergoing any genetic modification, and "Coordinators", who have modified their genes in some fashion. Essentially, coordinators are designer babies, made to have the most desirable traits in the aesthetic sense, or also in physical and mental ability. Naturals claim that Coordinators are an affront to humanity and engage in violence against them, leading to most Coordinators immigrating to space and establishing the "PLANTs", the Cosimic Era \(C.E.\) version of space colonies. Eventually, war breaks out between ZAFT, the PLANTs military force and the Earth Forces. Importantly, there is a third body, Blue Cosmos, which are the Lockheed Martin of SEED, and use the uncomfortably familiar slogan, "For the preservation of our blue and pure world". Now, I'm not going to say anything further about that, but it does have a similar ring to a 14-word phrase. I do believe that the similarity is at least somewhat intentional. Anyways, Kira, our protagonist, happens to be a Coordinator, but has been living alongside Naturals for many years. As he becomes involved in the conflict, he has to straddles both sides of the aisle, facing abuse and distrust from Naturals and being seen as a traitor by the Coordinators, never feeling any clear belonging to either side. It's not an uncommon way to portray racism and discrimination by any means, and it does so fairly well, albeit it is quite on the nose, leaving little room for any deeper introspection on the topic. You are spoon fed it, there is zero plausible deniability that it's a racism allegory.

The mobile suit designs of SEED are some of the best I've seen in the franchise thus far. Coming off of Gundam Wing's extravagant and sometimes campy mobile suit designs, SEED's mechanical designers did a fantastic job of giving weight, maintaining realistic movement, and making them aesthetically pleasing. The mobile suits are also quite unique in shapes. Of course, you have the recognizable Gundam and ZAKU platforms making a return, but other mobile suits like the wild cat inspired BuCUE's and the fish-like GOOhN's have unique silhouettes that make them stand out and memorable. Even the Gundam platform mobile suits are diverse enough that you can easily differentiate them if you stripped them of their unique color palettes. Serious props to the mechanical designer, Junichi Akutsu, on that.

Onto my many qualms with SEED as a franchise. Personally, I don't enjoy how it largely poised itself as a new version of the original U.C. Mobile Suit Gundam series. I understand that by 2002, the original series was 24 years old, and preferences and sensibilities have changed, but I don't like when series try and do this. It's one thing to reimagine, innovate, and draw inspiration from the source material, but when you can draw direct comparisions between characters, plot points, and settings from 0079 and SEED, it truly becomes uninspiring and boring to watch. I haven't touched on SEED Destiny yet, but I will here. Just as SEED is bad 0079, Destiny is bad Zeta. Character development that was seen throughout SEED was retconned in Destiny, with my main complaint being with Cagalli's character. I did not enjoy how they took her character from one that was naive about the world, but had a strong spirit and eventually stepped up when her father sacrificed himself, back to someone who was naive, incapable, and willing to bend the knee. If the purpose of her character arc in Destiny was to explore the trials of misogyny that a woman in power must face, they did a piss poor job of it, reducing her to a damsel in distress for much of the series, waiting for Prince Charming Athrun to return.

Destiny does do some things right, however. Athrun remains the most interesting character in the franchise. His journey is a great display of how indoctrination from his father and the military continue to loom over him, resulting in him nearly falling back into his old habits during SEED. Again, the only other interesting characters to me were Yzak and Dearka, where even with their limited screentime, are clearly pillars of the behind the scenes story, albeit they are portrayed as the "good guys" of ZAFT, the still murderous and eugenicist state.

SEED Freedom was... disappointing, to say the least. Instead of focusing on remnants of Blue Cosmos who narrowly escaped death during Destiny, we are introduced to a brand new nation that felt like they went through multiple design changes up until the premiere. This is, of course, a problem with many anime finale movies and OVAs in general, where the final bad guys feel entirely out of place with little connection to the story thus far. There is a noble attempt to tie in the human experimentation of Coordinators to this nation's leader, but the pacing is so poor that you barely connect the dots before her death, leaving you with more questions over a solid conclusion. Also, before I complain about my next point, I have to say I don't care about fanservice. I am well aware of the target demographic and sat through 88 episodes with someone's areolas on display during the openings and contless panty shots. However, there is nothing more jarring than being in the climax of the movie and suddenly having back-to-back shots of Lacus' boobs, butt and crotch filling the screen, mounting the mobile suit Darling in the FRANXX style. It was a poorly execute fanservice attempt. On the flip side \(and I am extremely biased but I believe my point still stands\), you can a perfectly timed fanservice attempt when Arthrun is fighting one of the Knights \(didn't care enough to learn their names\) and blocks out their Jedi mind tricks by imagining him fucking Cagalli. It is meant to be a comedic moment, but it doesn't remove you so much from the action as this scene is a fair slow down from previous scenes, but it's also pure fanservice for AsuCaga fans.
