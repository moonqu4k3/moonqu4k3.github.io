## BACKSTORY

Yukie was born in 1856 to an Ainu father and mother whom they never knew as she disappeared shortly after giving birth to Yukie. They were primarily raised by their father and aunt, their mother’s sister. As per Ainu tradition, they weren’t given a name until their personality manifested and were given the name Ruyanpe, meaning rain, as the months around their birthday were often the rainiest, and they enjoyed playing outside in it, no matter the conditions. Ruyanpe was a cheerful child, and always acted in the best interest of those around them, helping whoever and wherever they could. Once they were old enough, they would accompany their father on hunting trips, and proved themselves to be quite skilled, often being able to be so silent that a deer 4 feet from them wouldn’t know what hit them.

At age 10, when the Meiji restoration began, Yukie’s father gave them the name Yukie, believing they might have an easier life presenting as Japanese over Ainu. Yukie took the name with pride, as it was a gift from her father, but refused to cast away her Ainu heritage. Shortly thereafter, their father began working for a Japanese merchant, exposing him to cheap, hard labor. When Yukie was 14, their father suddenly passed away from an illness, but they still believe something else was at play. They spent the next few years working in their father’s stead until, at age 16, they engaged in a fight with the merchant, ending with Yukie being pierced through their shoulder, leaving them with a shooting star shaped scar. A female doctor happened to be nearby, effectively saving Yukie's life. Despite the treatment she offered, the injury left Yukie with reduced mobility in their right arm, causing them to have to learn to use their left hand. After they were healed, they ran away and began living as a vagrant. It was not an easy or good life choice and Yukie was put through tremendous amounts of near-death and traumatizing moments. As a result, they developed a very nihilistic worldview and denied any concept of "Good” or "Bad” as long as it aided in their survival, even when they weren’t sure they even wanted to persevere.

When they were about 18, they collapsed in front of a temple while they were in Kyoto, believing they had finally reached their limit. Miraculously, an old monk happened to find her and nurse her back to health. When they asked why he would do something like that, he said he was just following the dharma. For the next couple of weeks, Yukie stayed at the temple with the monk as he tried teaching her some sutras. Of course, Yukie can’t read, so he recites them out loud to her. The rest of the day, they would tend to the temple and its gardens and grounds. The monk became something of a father figure to them during their stay, almost 4 years after their father passed away. Eventually, when they felt they’d become too indebted if they stayed any longer, they set back out. 

After wandering around Japan for a couple more years, they eventually end up at a harbor, watching the docking ships, before an idea pops into their head...
