## BACKSTORY

Yukie was born in 1856 to an Ainu father and mother whom they never knew as she disappeared shortly after giving birth to Yukie. They were primarily raised by their father and aunt, their mother’s sister. As per Ainu tradition, they weren’t given a name until their personality manifested and were given the name Ruyanpe, meaning rain, as the months around their birthday were often the rainiest, and they enjoyed playing outside in it, no matter the conditions. Ruyanpe was a cheerful child, and always acted in the best interest of those around them, helping whoever and wherever they could. Once they were old enough, they would accompany their father on hunting trips, and proved themselves to be quite skilled, often being able to be so silent that a deer 4 feet from them wouldn’t know what hit them.

At age 10, when the Meiji restoration began, Yukie’s father gave them the name Yukie, believing they might have an easier life presenting as Japanese over Ainu. Yukie took the name with pride, as it was a gift from her father, but refused to cast away her Ainu heritage. Shortly thereafter, their father began working for a Japanese merchant, exposing him to cheap, hard labor. When Yukie was 14, their father suddenly passed away from an illness, but they still believe something else was at play. They spent the next few years working in their father’s stead until, at age 16, they engaged in a fight with the merchant, ending with Yukie being pierced through their shoulder, leaving them with a shooting star shaped scar. A female doctor happened to be nearby, effectively saving Yukie's life. Despite the treatment she offered, the injury left Yukie with reduced mobility in their right arm, causing them to have to learn to use their left hand. After they were healed, they ran away and began living as a vagrant. It was not an easy or good life choice and Yukie was put through tremendous amounts of near-death and traumatizing moments. As a result, they developed a very nihilistic worldview and denied any concept of "Good” or "Bad” as long as it aided in their survival, even when they weren’t sure they even wanted to persevere.

When they were about 18, they collapsed in front of a temple while they were in Kyoto, believing they had finally reached their limit. Miraculously, an old monk happened to find her and nurse her back to health. When they asked why he would do something like that, he said he was just following the dharma. For the next couple of weeks, Yukie stayed at the temple with the monk as he tried teaching her some sutras. Of course, Yukie can’t read, so he recites them out loud to her. The rest of the day, they would tend to the temple and its gardens and grounds. The monk became something of a father figure to them during their stay, almost 4 years after their father passed away. Eventually, when they felt they’d become too indebted if they stayed any longer, they set back out. 

After wandering around Japan for a couple more years, they eventually end up at a harbor, watching the docking ships, before an idea pops into their head...

## A Life Changing Meeting

Yukie walked aimlessly around the harbor, among the crewmen and foreigners flooding the docks.
"What a life it must be to be able to come and go as you please… not to mention the money that comes with it,” they said to themselves. After walking for a bit more, they stopped in their tracks. "Hold on a minute… I can do that…!” they realized, "If I can hide myself in crates outside a restaurant, waiting for them to close, why wouldn’t I be able to do the same on a ship!” Their sudden moment of clarity boosted their mood, and almost as if it was a sign from the heavens, they heard a foreman shouting "Over here! Bring those crates here, they’re going to Shanghai!” waving over to his crewmates.
"When the opportunity presents itself…”
They casually made their way over to the dock where the ship was sitting, taking a seat on some nearby barrels, and waiting for their opportunity to sneak aboard.
–
“I've seen farms with more security…” they said, walking down into the storage keep. It was packed tightly with crates of all sizes, many of them being quite substantial. 
"These are pretty big containers for a small ship… not that any ship is ever really small…” they said, tracing one of the crates. They walked to the back corner of the room, finding a small spot on top of some crates, mostly hidden from the entryway. "I should be able to stay right here and not have to worry about getting caught…or getting crushed.”
They climbed up and nestled themselves in the corner, getting as comfortable as they could.
"I guess it wouldn’t hurt if I closed my eyes for a bit… it’s been a while since I had a closed space to sleep in…” they thought, closing their eyes and quickly dozing off.
–
A sudden jolt awakened them, causing them to hit their head on the ceiling upon getting up.
"Eh?” they remarked, "Something doesn’t feel right,” and it wasn’t just the newly formed knot on their head. What they expected to hear upon awakening was the great bustling of Shanghai. Certainly, they heard the yelling from the crew above them as they worked to dock the ship, but otherwise, it was a far cry from what they expected.
"Did I dream that the ship was going to Shanghai,” they questioned, "No… I'm definitely sure this was the one!” they hopped down from their spot, carefully walking around the storage keep, peering around before moving to their next spot. They heard a grinding noise to their left, turning their head to see what it was, being faced with a falling crate.
"Fuck…!” they exclaimed, quickly throwing themselves backward, falling into another crate in the process, knocking the lid off slightly. They lifted their hand upon noticing the top had moved, and, letting their curiosity get the best of them, looked inside at its contents. Suddenly, their eyes widened, and they took a step back, "What the hell is this…” they uttered. It was a large metal creation, far larger and likely heavier than any human should be able to carry. "Is it… some sort of cannon?” they wondered. Turning back around to the box that had nearly fallen onto them, it had all but smashed, leaving rounds of ammunition littering the floor.
"What was that noise?” they heard someone say from above them.
"Shit…!” they exclaimed. Frantically looking around for a place to hide, they darted to their left in a tight out-cove between some crates.
"I know I heard a noise down here. Did something fall?”
"Over there, some of the ammo crates.”
"Shit… the boss isn’t gonna be too pleased about this.”
Yukie felt an itch under their nose, "Fuck…!? The gunpowder?! Hold it in, hold it in…!”
"Nothing else is damaged, right? It looks like generic bullets. It shouldn’t be too much of a problem to explain.”
"Let’s hope so…”
"Achoo…!”
The two men stopped in their tracks. "Fuck… I've really done it now…” they muttered, reaching to their left side for their makiri.
"Show yourself!” one of the men called out, while the other made his way to where Yukie was hiding. Immediately before he reached them, Yukie jumped out first, brandishing their dagger, and startling the man. Using this moment to catch him off guard, they kicked him in the stomach, getting him to double over, grabbing his arms and pinning them behind him, holding the knife up to his throat.
"Take me to your boss right now, or you’ll have a bigger problem to explain,” they demanded. It was all a ruse, they had no intention of harming the poor guy any further, let alone with something as important to them as their makiri. Still, it was working, the other crewmate seemed apprehensive, backing away slightly. "Didn’t you hear me?” They repeated, "I said take me to your–” They were suddenly cut off by the presence of someone behind them, attempting to overtake them too. Quickly enough, they let the other man go, ducking out of the way of the second. Unfortunately, they ducked right into another crate, their momentary daze causing them to get them apprehended.
"There were more down here…?!”
The first man walked back over to them, crouching down in front of them, "Not a problem, we’ll take you to the boss, alright.” the man leered.
"I have a feeling I've gotten myself involved in something I shouldn’t have…”
–
"Get the fuck off me!” they called out over and over, rocking the small boat they were taking to the shore.
"Keep moving around and you’ll be seeing your god before the boss,” the man said, "And you certainly won’t be taking this with you to your meeting,” he added, reaching for the makiri that was sitting on the bottom of the boat, dangling it in front of them.
"Put it down.” they ordered, suddenly putting out a much more threatening air. It got to the man, who apprehensively set it back down. The boat suddenly rocked harshly, then stopped, signaling their arrival on shore. Two men took hold of Yukie again, pulling them out of the boat as they fell into the water, desperately trying to get away and managing to get one arm free before a third man came to restrain them.
"You’re putting up more of a fight than you should be, you’re just making it harder on yourself,” the man said.
"Eat shit,” they spat out.
"What is going on over here?” a voice spoke. Yukie peered around their captors, searching for the source of the voice, assuming it to be this "Boss”. All they saw before them were four abnormally broad and tall men, with a much smaller – and not just by comparison – man dressed in black standing in the middle of them. Suddenly, they burst into laughter. Everyone in attendance turned to look at them, a reaction completely unbefitting of the situation.
"What…?!” the man in black seethed, "What is so funny…?!”
"You– you’re this “boss” everyone keeps talking about…?!” they got out in between breaths of laughter, "You gotta be kidding me…! This guy’s less threatening than a puppy!”
His face contorted in embarrassment and anger, "You…! You have the gall to try and humiliate me…?!” he yelled out, reaching for the gun in his shirt, and pointing it at Yukie.
"Woah…! Easy boy, I was just teasing. No need to brandish your fangs at me… not that it’s all that scary,” they quipped.
"You…!”
Enishi made his way over to the shore, greeting the foreman and confirming the shipment. He couldn’t ignore the commotion that was taking place not far from him, as much as he would’ve liked to. Passing the receipts back to the foreman, he decided to check in, albeit begrudgingly.
"Heixing, what’s going on over here?”
"Boss, as you can see, there was a rat on board,” he said, barely retaining his composure, and gesturing over to the person currently being restrained by four crewmen now. 
"Get your hands off of me! I'll bite them off if I have to!” they yelled, kicking and struggling to break free. Upon hearing the word "Boss” uttered, though, they came out of their fit. 
"Boss…? So, you’re the one in charge and not this oddly aging child?” they said, earning a lunge from Heixing, but Enishi put up his hand before anything further could commence. Enishi stared at the person in front of him, still slightly wiggling to try and break free.
"Who are you?” he interrogated.
"What’s it matter to you?” they shot back. 
"How did you get aboard my ship?” he asked again.
"I dunno, pretty much waltzed right on. You’d think an illegal arms dealer might have better security,” Yukie noticed a twitch in Enishi’s eye, "Ooh, did I hit the mark?”
Enishi looked at them for a moment longer, saying, "Heixing, get rid of him,” before beginning to turn away until they caught his eye again. They were staring back at him with the most unfazed expression, not even bothered that his life was just ordered to be cut short. Enishi wanted to shake that look out of his mind, but it was difficult. Still, he walked off.
"Go ahead and kill me, I'll bet you’ll get knocked back by that pistol before the bullet even fires!” he heard them taunt. "Faced with death and they still continue to remain unbothered…” he thought to himself.
“I'll shoot your earrings off one by one the longer you keep running your mouth!” Heixing yelled out.
"Try it! I'll make you play fetch with them if I survive!” they returned.
"You certainly don’t often find someone willing to challenge the Shanghai mafia like that…” he continued to think. The image of their expression, completely unfaltering, kept reappearing in his mind. It was a face almost familiar to him, though he couldn’t pinpoint from where. Somehow, it was enough to make a pit form in his stomach. Suddenly, a gunshot rang clear through the open air. 
"You missed,” Yukie remarked, though that was not necessarily the case. Enishi turned back around to see droplets of blood being absorbed into the sand, and a latent instinct in him kicked in as he stormed back over to the scene.
"Heixing. Don’t you dare make another move, or your blood will stain the sand next.” the man suddenly ordered.
"But boss–”, he uttered.
"Didn’t you hear me? Don’t. You. Move.”
Yukie thought they had caught a glimpse of something near the man’s eye, but they were still just far enough away that they couldn’t tell. Heixing backed away, and Enishi made his way forward, starting to get a better look at the situation. A small streak of blood trickled down their neck, but no discernable wounds, at least not that he could see right now.
Soon, he was standing before the stowaway again, saying to them, "What is it you want?”
"What?”
“I'll pay you to get back on this ship and go back to where you came from.”
"You’re asking a lot from me. I don’t exactly have a place to go back to.”
Enishi stood silently for a moment, shocked at their words. 
“I'm doing you a favor here by sparing your life.”
"Are you really? Or do you just feel like you are?” Yukie called into question, "Did you ever stop to consider that maybe I had a motive for getting on your ship that didn’t involve sabotage? I could seriously care less about your business, all I heard was that this ship was going to Shanghai, and I finally saw that as my ticket out of that hellscape.”
Enishi recognized those words and feelings all too well, the hatred of Japan that made him leave as well. He couldn’t know their personal reasons behind it, but it developed the smallest bit of camaraderie.
"So, what? Do you want to go there instead?”
"Not anymore.”
“‘Not anymore?’” he repeated, “I'm trying to honor your requests.”
"The only thing you’re trying to do is protect your integrity.”
"Is this the same stubbornness that’s kept you alive thus far?”
"Now you’re starting to get it,” they quipped back. Pausing for a moment, they played their last card, "Let me stay here.”
"Absolutely not.”
"I don’t see what the problem would be. It won't be forever, just until I decide where I wanna go.”
"And I should let you reside here with nothing in return? I almost wish I'd never gone back on my order.”
"Not for nothing in return,” they said, "I can work for you.”
"Forget about it,” he said, "You’ll be leaving as soon as the cargo is unloaded. I'll drag you back on the ship personally if I have to.”
"It took four of your men to just barely hold me back, you think you’d be able to do it on your own?” Suddenly, Yukie twisted their arms free, jolting forward to stand in front of Enishi. The crewmen moved to grab them again, but Enishi put up his hand signaling to stay put.
“I'm not smart enough to help with your business, but I can cook a damn good meal. You don’t look like you eat all that well,” they added, looking at him up and down, "You can’t weigh much more than I do, which is saying something. I somehow doubt that you’re the type of guy who has a personal chef or anything like that.”
"My answer remains the same. You can try and plead all you want, just know it’s falling on deaf ears.”
"Do you know how to cook?” they pestered.
"What?”
"It’s a simple question, idiot. Can you even make anything worthwhile to eat?”
Enishi stayed silent, but Yukie continued, "I know I'm right, you really can’t. I'm perceptive with these kinds of things.” Yukie walked closer to Enishi, “I'll make a deal of my own: you let me stay here as your live-in servant, you don’t have to pay me, just give me a room, doesn’t have to be a nice one either, and access to the kitchen. If you’re worried about me leaking information about your business, I don’t know anyone, let alone even how to read or write.”
Enishi noticed another drop of blood fall to the ground below, something that they almost seemed unaware of, and it was making Enishi more and more sick to look at. Not being able to look at them any longer, he had no choice but to concede.
"Fine,” Enishi huffed, "But under one more condition: don’t bother me.” he enunciated.
"Deal,” Yukie agreed, "Now… how do you even get up there?” they said, gesturing up toward the mansion on the cliff. Without speaking, Enishi turned around and began walking. "Hey! Are you gonna tell me or not!?” Yukie yelled to him, huffing and pouting before running over to follow him, leaving all who witnessed their exchange in shock.
–
The two walked in silence up the rocky and uneven path to the mansion. "Hey, boss man, is this seriously where you live? And do you seriously not have a maid or anything like that? I was just saying things in hopes one of them would hit the mark, but you agreed to my totally bogus deal, so I have to be right… right?” they pestered, with Enishi still not answering. "Are you listening to me? And how much farther is it? Since you can’t cook, do you even have anything in your kitchen? I was too busy trying to plan my escape that I didn’t see if there were any fish in the cove, but I'm sure if I–” 
 Enishi suddenly cut them off, "Were you listening to me at all? The one and only rule I set was not to bother me, and you’re doing just that.”
“I'm doing you a favor! I'm offering— “
"No, I'm the one doing the favor here,” he reiterated, "I could’ve let Heixing do away with you and toss your body to the sharks.”
"But you didn’t,” they reminded him, "So why?”
Enishi stopped in his tracks for a moment, before casting a sharp glance back at them, "It’s not something I have to explain to you,” he continued walking again, leaving Yukie for a moment to try and process what he meant, before continuing as well.
"We’re here,” he announced shortly after.
It was a Western-style mansion with a yellowish-cream exterior and green accents. A large balcony stretched off of the west side. It wasn’t incredibly opulent like it had seemed from down on the shore, but it was still unlike anything Yukie had ever seen.
"Are you just going to stand there and gawk or are you ever going to take care of that blood on you?” Enishi barked, interrupting said gawking, which is exactly what they were doing.
"Blood?” they questioned, raising their hand to their face and feeling for a wound, eventually figuring out what he was talking about when they saw their fingertips stained with red after touching their right ear. 
"Did they seriously have no clue?” Enishi thought to himself. "I missed what happened for them to bleed like that, but still… to not even be aware of it? What’s up with this person?” he pondered, certainly being the last person to question others like that. "Go wash yourself off, I'll get you bandages if you need them.”
“I'll be fine, just show me where the kitchen is,” Yukie said. Enishi looked at them with prying eyes, but knowing he wasn’t going to find out anything further. "It’s straight back,” he answered shortly.
–
Yukie grabbed a knife from the block, using it as a makeshift mirror, "It doesn’t look like it’s ever been used…” they thought aloud. Tilting the knife to see their ear, they pushed their hair aside, strands stuck together with dried blood. "Aah, so that’s what happened…” a chunk of their ear had been shot off, along with whatever hair had been in the way, making their already uneven and disheveled haircut even more so.
"Any further left and my entire ear probably would’ve been blown off, or at least enough to cause some damage,” they spoke as if they weren’t now missing the outer cartilage of their ear.
"Better look for a washcloth or something…” they mumbled, rooting around through drawers until they happened upon a small hand towel. "Hope he wasn’t attached to this,” they said, soaking it before beginning to wipe the blood off their face, hair, and clothes. Enishi watched silently from around the corner, his face contorting as he desperately tried to make out the character of his new housemate. Suddenly, he tossed a roll of bandages onto the counter.
"Here. Use those,” he spoke harshly. Yukie whipped around to face him, "Ah, don’t worry about it! It’s stopped bleeding already!” they exclaimed as they pushed their hair out of the way to reveal their gnarled ear. Enishi quickly turned away, attempting to contain the disgust he felt rising in his gut.
"Why is it that I can’t bear to look at them?”
Yukie looked on at him in confusion as he stumbled away without a word. 
"What a confusing man…” they set the blood-stained cloth onto the counter and walked out into the opulent mansion. It was decorating with a mix of Chinese and Western furniture, creating the atmosphere that they were in a brand new country. Granted, they didn’t know where they were in the world, but nothing they could see reminded them of Japan. “It might not end up being so bad here afterall,” they thought. Taking a seat on a less comfortable than it looked lounge chair, they laid back, enjoying a level of silence and safety they thought they’d never experience again.
