I really, really enjoy fashion. I love putting together outfits and wearing them out, experimenting with outfits and, of course, shopping for them. My top method of acquring new clothes is thrifting and, somewhat separately, estate sales. As an aside, if you have a rich neighborhood within your area, you absolutely have to check your local auction house and estate sale listings. Looting the households of old rich people is so much fun and you will find treasures. Anyways, thrifting has become far more socially acceptable over the past 5 years, and as such, people who would have never been seen in those mothball ridden buildings are now their number one patrons. I'm not here to talk specifically about the economy of thrift resellers \(though I may at a later date\), but I wanted to rather talk about the gatekeeping aspect of some thrifters. 

As someone who gets at least some sort of compliment on my outfits whenever I'm out, the follow-up is always "where did you get \[insert clothing item\]?". I don't keep lists of every article of clothing I own \(yet\), but I can generally remember what brand something is from, or at the very least try and check the tag. Unfortunately for the person I've struck up a conversation with, it's not always a recognizable name, which particularly goes for my 70s Victorian-style blouses. Even still, I view it as a courtesy so I can at least point someone in the right direction if they happen to covet something in a similar style. However, I've come to learn that not everyone will extend a hand like that. Sometimes, "oh, I thrifted it!" is the end of that conversation. ...Personally, I refuse to believe that not a single article of clothing or accessory didn't come with a tag, business card, or even a receipt. I can understand to a point wanting to "gatekeep" a couple of things to protect your personal style from becoming Pinterest fodder, but you really can't even give me the initials of the brand of handbag you have? 

One of my theories as to why people do this is because, well, they really don't have a brand. The current fashion ecosystem is so clogged with cookie-cutter 5 random letter Amazon storefronts, Shein and their fake alternative brand, Romwe, and Temu/AliExpress's stolen, 200% polyester designs. These companies have seemingly made fashion more "accessible" at the severe cost of plastic clothes, abuse of low-wage labor, fossil fuel consumption, and theft from honest artists. Whether people don't say the brand because they really don't know it, or out of shame, it probably depends on the person. I'll admit I have Shein clothing in my wardrobe from before I considered the ethics of buying from them, and if someone asks about it, I will say it's from Shein... "but I got in in like 2020 with my pandemic check and I haven't bought anything from them since" is always the immediate follow-up. But it has reached a point where these clothes are making their way into the thrift stores too. I've been duped many times but a nice looking piece, only to check the tag and see the name staring back at me. I do believe it's relatively fine to buy these clothes back from thrifts, after all, the money is going to the store, and whoever donated it at least had enough of a conscience to not throw it out instead. 

The other reason people do this is just simply because of the moral superiority you feel from saying "I thrifted it!". It certainly does feel nicer to buy from a local consignment store \(Goodwill is an ableist corporation and, well, a corporation. Always buy from local businesses when you can\) than somewhere like H&M. 

In all, I would just really prefer if people could share
