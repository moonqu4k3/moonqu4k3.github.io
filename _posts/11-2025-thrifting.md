I really, really enjoy fashion. I love putting together outfits and wearing them out, experimenting with outfits and, of course, shopping for them. My top method of acquring new clothes is thrifting and, somewhat separately, estate sales. As an aside, if you have a rich neighborhood within your area, you absolutely have to check your local auction house and estate sale listings. Looting the households of old rich people is so much fun and you will find treasures. Anyways, thrifting has become far more socially acceptable over the past 5 years, and as such, people who would have never been seen in those mothball ridden buildings are now their number one patrons. I'm not here to talk specifically about the economy of thrift resellers \(though I may at a later date\), but I wanted to rather talk about the gatekeeping aspect of some thrifters. 

As someone who gets at least some sort of compliment on my outfits whenever I'm out, the follow-up is always "where did you get \[insert clothing item\]?". I don't keep lists of every article of clothing I own \(yet\), but I can generally remember what brand something is from, or at the very least try and check the tag. Unfortunately for the person I've struck up a conversation with, it's not always a recognizable name, which particularly goes for my 70s Victorian-style blouses. Even still, I view it as a courtesy so I can at least point someone in the right direction if they happen to covet something in a similar style. However, I've come to learn that not everyone will extend a hand like that. Sometimes, "oh, I thrifted it!" is the end of that conversation. ...Personally, I refuse to believe that not a single article of clothing or accessory didn't come with a tag, business card, or even a receipt. I can understand to a point wanting to "gatekeep" a couple of things to protect your personal style from becoming Pinterest fodder, but you really can't even give me the initials of the brand of handbag you have? 

One of my theories as to why people do this is because, well, they really don't have a brand. The current fashion ecosystem is so clogged with cookie-cutter 5 random letter Amazon storefronts, Shein and their fake alternative brand, Romwe, and Temu/AliExpress's stolen, 200% polyester designs. These companies have seemingly made fashion more "accessible" at the severe cost of plastic clothes, abuse of low-wage labor, fossil fuel consumption, and theft from honest artists. Whether people don't say the brand because they really don't know it, or out of shame, it probably depends on the person. I'll admit I have Shein clothing in my wardrobe from before I considered the ethics of buying from them, and if someone asks about it, I will say it's from Shein... "but I got in in like 2020 with my pandemic check and I haven't bought anything from them since" is always the immediate follow-up. But it has reached a point where these clothes are making their way into the thrift stores too. I've been duped many times by a nice looking piece, only to check the tag and see the name staring back at me. I do believe it's relatively fine to buy these clothes back from thrifts, after all, the money is going to the store, and whoever donated it at least had enough of a conscience to not throw it out instead. This point speaks more to the fast fashion pollution, in both the literal sense and it's invasive entrance into the thrifting ecosystem, than the gatekeeping of thrifting, but I still wanted to bring it up.

The other reason people do this is just simply because of the moral superiority you feel from saying "I thrifted it!". It certainly does feel nicer to buy from a local consignment store \(Goodwill is an ableist corporation and, well, a corporation. Always buy from local businesses when you can\) than somewhere like H&M or Forever 21 \(R.I.P.\). This moral superiority gets into people's heads much in the same way people would gatekeep bands and musicians with the "you wouldn't know them" attitude. In reality, many of the brands that end up in thrift stores are not bespoke pieces and are usually just someone's spring cleaning of seasons old department store attire. That is to say they are a dime a dozen. You certainly can find high-quality, expensive vintage at thrifts; I came across a Carlisle Collection ruffled silk blouse some months ago, and quickly discovered that one had recently sold for ~$170 on eBay. I frequent a vintage store in Cape Cod when I go for family vacation, and have walked out with genuine, great condition Gunne Sax and other 1960-70s blouses for prices that rival what you pay for a graphic tee in this day and age. I don't really even understand the gatekeeping of vintage brands. They truly aren't in any amount of limited supply; many of the "vintage" brands today were also stocked in big department stores. And yet, you see people refusing to name anything in their outfits, even if you can clearly tell they're wearing Lucky Brand jeans \(gatekeeping jeans is particularly egregious to me because denim brands thrive on the free advertising from their labels\), a Worthington camisole, and a Hollister zip-up. This is definitely more so an issue in the "Y2K" \(sorry for all the side notes, but also people using Y2K as a blanket for anything from like 1995 until 2015 is a pet peeve of mine\) side of thrifting. I'm more in the mid-century side of thrifting, and clothing that reminds people of their grandmas aren't appealing to the average Depop reseller. But by gatekeeping a Macy's exclusive brand sweater from Fall 2014, what do you gain? If I'm not going to find the same piece you have, someone else is going to. I want to talk about J-fashion gatekeeping too, because that is it's own monster, but I think I'll save that for another post.

In all, I would just really prefer if people could share their fashion tips, tricks, and brands with others. I personally believe that fashion is far more enjoyable when you're able to collaborate, whether it's through sharing sewing patterns, altering tips, store recommendations, constructing style boards, and whatever else collaboration might mean to you. Sharing a passion with another person is one of the simplest joys in the world, and being bitter and guarded just makes you an unlikeable person. You don't need to share an exact breakdown of every outfit you've ever worn, but you should extend a hand to someone who clearly is looking to you as an inspiration. We would all live happier lives with this mindset.
