2102\. A continent is divided into 9 distinct economic blocs. Political borders have been dissolved, but social ones remain in place. Sector 4 is the hub of underworld dealings, and “digicaps”, drugs targeting biomechanical implants, are turning the inhabitants into mindless droids. Odd jobs agency HEX takes on cases that others won’t. What starts as a few isolated incidents eventually points to a larger conspiracy, one that might have connected everyone from the very start.
